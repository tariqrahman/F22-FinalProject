# Summary

With our project, we hope to resurrect the short-lived yet immensely popular mobile game Flappy Bird. The goal of the game is to steer your bird through the spaces between a pair of pipes. For each space successfully navigated, the user gains a point. The game ends when the user collides with a pipe. Additionally, to make for a more immersive experience, the user will have the option to play the game from the perspective of the bird. This allows us to encapsulate 3D rendering as opposed to the traditional 2D rendition of Flappy Bird. Rather than utilizing the classic bird, we may design a flying bruin avatar if time permits!
